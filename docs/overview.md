**Philosophical base.** Deleuze’s difference and becoming: contexts are not static labels but stratified, dynamic regimes of distinction.

**Technical field.** Differential geometry gives language for **strata / flows / boundaries**; we treat a “context” as a small structured space where reasoning steps trace flows across strata with admissible boundaries.

**Structural implementation.** Category‑theoretic **pullbacks**: for two domain contexts C and D, an intermediate context **L** and functors _u: L→C_, _v: L→D_ witness alignment when the step‑graphs from C and D pull back to a shared core diagram _G★_.

**Metric (toy).** LSC‑PB computes a normalized residual Δ between the two L‑normalized step multisets; score `s = 1 − Δ`. In practice you would extend this to graph‑level equivalences and layered invariants; the demo stays intentionally minimal.
