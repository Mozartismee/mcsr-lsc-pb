# Deleuze → Diff‑Geo → Pullback (Primer)

**Aim.** Make cross‑domain context alignment auditable.

1) **Deleuze (philosophy).** Difference and becoming: contexts are generative regimes, not static labels.
2) **Differential geometry (field).** Model strata, flows, and boundaries; treat contexts as structured spaces.
3) **Category theory (implementation).** Use pullbacks: alignment exists when two domain‑specific traces admit a shared core via an intermediate context L.

**Outcome.** A metric (LSC‑PB) and a minimal SDK so third parties can rerun a toy case in minutes.
